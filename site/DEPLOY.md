Deploy notes (structure-only)

Recommended quick hosts:
- Cloudflare Pages: static + CDN, simple GitHub integration.
- GitHub Pages: simplest for static sites.
- Vercel/Netlify: if PR preview links or serverless forms needed.

After you approve the structure I will add a build tool (if needed), CI, and deployment config.
