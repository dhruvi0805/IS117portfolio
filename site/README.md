Site scaffold for AGENTS portfolio

This folder contains the initial scaffold for the portfolio site.

STATUS: Structure ready for approval. No implementation logic added.

Structure overview:
- public/index.html — skeleton pages and layout placeholders
- src/styles/main.css — base styles (placeholder)
- content/case-studies/*.md — case study placeholders
- assets/images/ — image assets (placeholders)
- package.json — minimal metadata
- DEPLOY.md — deploy notes and recommendations

Next: after you approve the structure I will implement the site logic, styles, and build/deploy configuration.
